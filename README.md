# OSSEC Wazuh RESTful API

OSSEC Wazuh RESTful API is a service to control OSSEC Wazuh manager using REST requests. It allows you to execute OSSEC commands for agents remote management (add, restart, info, key export) or to extract rootcheck and syscheck information (restart, check last scan...). The goal is to provide an interface to manage your OSSEC deployment remotely (e.g. through a web browser), or to integrate OSSEC with external systems.
